## Overview

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a 2.4 GHz antenna using **CST Studio Suite** and **MATLAB**. It is aimed at the **ISM band (2.4–2.5 GHz)**, which is extensively used in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and IoT applications. The design process is facilitated through MATLAB scripting and leverages the [CST-MATLAB-API](https://github.com/simos421/CST-MATLAB-API) for antenna generation and analysis.
